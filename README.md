## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
Adding a new student: Users can add new students to the system, providing necessary details like name, roll number, and grade.
Editing an existing studentâ€™s information: Users can update the details of existing students in the system.
Searching for a student: Users can search for a student using their roll number.
Displaying all students: Users can view the details of all students in the system.
Saving and loading student data: The system allows users to save the current student data to a file and load it back when needed.
The system ensures robustness by implementing input validation to check that required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format.

This project serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to understand how a basic management system works. Feel free to clone, modify, and use it as per your needs.
